---

## Problem Definition & Solution

### The Core Problem

Organizations with moderate to high hiring volumes face resource-intensive recruitment processes plagued by three critical challenges:

1. **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual screening consumes 30-40% of hiring cycle time without proportional quality improvement
2. **Subjective Bias:** Human screeners introduce unconscious bias, affecting fairness and creating legal exposure under LGPD
3. **Scalability Constraints:** Hiring volume increases require proportional increases in recruiting staff, driving costs

The market opportunity emerges from a structural constraint: companies cannot efficiently evaluate 50-200 candidates per position without significant operational overhead.

### Hirefy's Value Proposition

Hirefy delivers value across five dimensions:

**Time Value:** Parallel processing of multiple candidates through autonomous agents reduces time-to-hire by 40-60%, accelerating offer acceptance before candidates accept competing offers.

**Cost Value:** Elimination of manual screening labor reduces cost-per-hire from R$3,000-8,000 to R$41-55 per screening interview, achieving ROI within the first month for organizations conducting 20+ screenings monthly.

**Quality Value:** Standardized assessment criteria applied uniformly across all candidates eliminate subjective bias and ensure consistent evaluation standards.

**Experience Value:** 24/7 interview availability with rapid feedback improves candidate experience, strengthens employer brand, and increases offer acceptance rates.

**Scale Value:** Organizations process significantly more candidates without proportional increases in recruiting staff, enabling faster hiring at lower cost.

### Solution Hypotheses

**Problem Hypothesis:** Companies with 20+ annual hiring positions experience material operational costs and delays from manual screening and will invest in automated solutions that demonstrably reduce costs while maintaining quality.

**Solution Hypothesis:** Autonomous AI agents with real-time voice synthesis can conduct screenings indistinguishable from human interactions. This assumes: (1) Large Language Models can reliably follow structured interview methodologies, (2) Voice synthesis quality reaches human indistinguishability, (3) Real-time processing enables natural conversation flow, and (4) Multilingual capabilities maintain consistent assessment quality.

**Value Hypothesis:** Consumption-based pricing at R$2.75/minute with R$1,100 minimum monthly commitment represents acceptable value proportional to cost reduction benefits for target customers.

- Market advantage: Matches 215 million Portuguese speakers across Brazil and emerging markets

**2. Exclusive Behavioral Assessment Integration**

- Embedded partnership with established behavioral assessment methodology provider
- Validated psychological frameworks integrated into autonomous interviews
- Assessment credentials create perceived credibility and compliance confidence
- Competitive advantage: Direct integration of validated assessment methodology vs. generic screening questions
- Market advantage: Customers gain recruiting efficacy without separate behavioral assessment licensing

### Competitive Positioning

Hirefy is positioned between **cost-focused solutions** (e.g., simple chatbots) and **enterprise-heavy solutions** (e.g., HireVue). The strategy targets the **mid-market efficiency segment**—organizations with sufficient hiring volume to justify investment but lacking resources for enterprise-tier solutions.
